# Sentiment analysis using deep learning with Azure Machine Learning

Sentiment analysis is a well-known task in the realm of natural language processing. Given a set of texts, the objective is to determine the polarity of that text. The objective of this lab is to use CNTK as the backend for Keras and implement sentiment analysis from movie reviews.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a well-known task in the realm of natural language processing. Given a set of texts, the objective is to determine the sentiment of that text. This example demonstrates the use CNTK as the backend for Keras to perform sentiment analysis from movie reviews.

## Key components needed to run this example

1. An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) (free trials are available).
2. An installed copy of Azure Machine Learning Workbench with a workspace created.
3. The deployment part of this example is run on a Linux DSVM.
